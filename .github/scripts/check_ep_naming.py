"""Validate enhancements/ directory and file naming for paths new to a PR.

Directories and files that already existed at the PR base branch are
grandfathered — this only enforces the naming convention on new work.

Enforcement requires a PR base SHA (set via PRE_COMMIT_PR_BASE_SHA, always
present in the CI pre-commit job). Local runs without it are advisory-only
(a note is printed, nothing is flagged) so the git hook never blocks a
commit that CI would pass.
